# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Load data X_Train 
# Load data Y_Train 
# Load data Subject Train
# Load data X_Test
# Load data Y_Test
# Load data Subject Test
# Join datasets

# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# Load the features
# Search the mean and stddvt
# Join the data and cleaning

# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Load the dataset activity labels
# Clean the dataset

# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# Merge the tables and write provisory file


# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
